# AI-Powered Code Demo Documentation System

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Code Demo Documentation System** is a platform designed to create interactive, step-by-step coding tutorials. This platform enables developers to guide users through specific coding tasks or concepts in a structured and intuitive way.

Each documentation consists of multiple steps, where each step helps users understand, implement, and verify their progress on a given task.

## Key Features

Each tutorial/documentation step includes the following elements:

1. **Explanation**: 
   - A brief description of the concept or task being covered in the step. This provides users with context and background information about the current step.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - A relevant code example demonstrating the concept or task. Users can refer to this code to understand how to implement the feature.

3. **Instructions**:
   - Clear and concise instructions on what the user needs to do, such as modifying the code snippet, adding new functionality, or running a specific command.
